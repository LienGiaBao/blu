                                            Bạc Liêu has long been recognized as the cradle of Southern amateur music. This region has produced numerous talented artists and musicians, and has given birth to countless timeless compositions. With over 70 clubs, groups, and teams, and approximately 500 artists involved, these numbers attest to the vibrant vitality and enduring legacy of Southern amateur music among the people of Bạc Liêu.
                                            </p> 
    
                                        
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        According to historical records, in the early 20th century, numerous music groups emerged in the South, performing in the tài tử style and rapidly spreading throughout the six provinces of Cochinchina before gradually expanding to other provinces and cities nationwide. In 2013, at the 8th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Baku, Azerbaijan, Vietnam's Southern amateur music was officially recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Prior to this, this distinctive art form had already been included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage List by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.</p>
                                        <p> Throughout the history of Southern amateur music, it is impossible to overlook the immense contributions of artists and musicians, particularly those from Bạc Liêu. As People's Artist Lê Long Vân (Ba Vân) noted in his work "Kể chuyện Cải lương" (Tales of cải lương): "Bạc Liêu is the cradle of the Southern amateur music movement, a land that has produced many talented artists and musicians. Hai Khị (Nhạc Khị), considered the master of traditional music, was also from Bạc Liêu, and his son, Ba Chột, became a renowned musician as well."</p>

                                <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, musician Lê Tài Khí (1870-1948), often called Nhạc Khị, established a ceremonial music band to serve the rituals and ceremonies of local temples and families. This was the first ceremonial music band in Bạc Liêu. Nhạc Khị is credited with making significant contributions to Southern amateur music by refining and revising the 20 fundamental pieces, earning him the respect of traditional musicians as the "Later Ancestor." He dedicated himself to perfecting and completing various compositions in the three South, six North, four Oán categories. </p>

                                <p> Together with Sư Nguyệt Chiếu and Bảy Kiên, Nhạc Khị successfully completed this task in the early 20th century. In the absence of printing facilities at that time, Nhạc Khị's successors recorded his work, which was later compiled by Trịnh Thiên Tư in his work "Ca nhạc cổ điển" (Classical Music). This is the intellectual achievement of a group of pioneering artists in Bạc Liêu, documenting all the contents of the six Bắc, seven Bài, three Nam, four Oán, and new compositions by contemporary musicians.</p>
                                <p>Most of the ancient music compositions in Bạc Liêu at that time had humanistic meanings, particularly historical themes. The piece "Thủy tổ Hồng Bàng" (The Ancestor Hồng Bàng), performed in the "Lưu thủy trường" style, is a magnificent example of how the author linked the first chapter of Vietnamese history with the first piece of the 20 fundamental pieces. This was followed by a series of Vietnamese dynasties presented in the order of the "Phú lục," "Bình bán," "Xuân tình," "Tây thi," "Cổ bản," "Xàng xê," "Ngũ đối thượng," "Ngũ đối hạ," </p>
                                <p>"Long đăng," "Long ngâm," "Vạn giá," "Tiểu khúc," "Nam xuân," "Nam ai," "Đảo ngũ cung," "Tứ đại oán," "Phụng hoàng," "Phụng cầu," and "Giang nam" pieces. Other new compositions or adaptations celebrated heroes and heroines, extolling the virtues of patriotism, bravery, and sacrifice.   </p>
                                <p>By the 1930s, Southern amateur music in Bạc Liêu experienced growth in both quantity and quality, gaining widespread recognition throughout Cochinchina. Numerous Southern amateur music artists emerged from Bạc Liêu, many of whom became professional musicians, most of whom were trained by Nhạc Khị, including Sáu Lầu, Cai Đệ, Mười Khói, Ba Chột, Tư Bình, Hai Tài, Trịnh Thiên Tư, Mộng Vân, Năm Nhỏ, Lý Khi, Tư Quận... Others were trained by Sư Nguyệt Chiếu, such as artists Lư Hòa Nghĩa, Sanh Xía, Chín Quy, Thiện Ý, and Thiện Ngộ.</p>
                                <p>The tradition of cổ nhạc continued to flow. One of Nhạc Khị's most talented students was Cao Văn Lầu (1892-1976), also known as Sáu Lầu, the composer of "Dạ cổ hoài lang." Born in the Cái Cui hamlet (Chí Mỹ, Vàm Cỏ, Long An), due to difficult circumstances, his family wandered to many places before settling in Bạc Liêu. It was there, under the tutelage of musician Lê Tài Khị, that his musical talent began to flourish.</p>
                                <p>The influence of Southern amateur music continued to spread. With his intelligence, diligence, and a natural musical talent inherited from his family, Cao Văn Lầu excelled in everything he learned, from Chinese characters to French and playing instruments. He could learn a new piece after hearing it only once. After just a few months of studying, his teacher Hai Khị noticed his exceptional talent and invited him to join his ceremonial music band.</p>
                                <p>After Hai Khị's death, determined to carry on his teacher's legacy, he gathered his fellow musicians to form the Bạc Liêu Southern amateur music band. This band played a significant role in popularizing Southern amateur music, not only in Bạc Liêu but throughout Cochinchina. At that time, Bạc Liêu primarily performed the 20 fundamental pieces of Southern amateur music. In addition, Bạc Liêu artists contributed hundreds of new compositions based on old melodies.</p>
                                <p>Driven by deep affection for his beloved wife and the social reality of the time, when many women had husbands conscripted by the French, Cao Văn Lầu composed "Dạ cổ hoài lang." This piece, expressing both personal and collective sorrow, has endured and evolved for nearly a century, exerting a profound influence on people.</p>
                                <p>In his book "Tìm hiểu âm nhạc cải lương" (Exploring cải lương music), researcher Đắc Nhẫn wrote: "Dạ cổ hoài lang not only captures the sentiments and emotions of a generation but also demonstrates the unique structure, the balance of yin and yang, and the skillful combination of melodies of a new form of musical art, developed based on traditional elements... making the work more appealing and providing rich artistic imagery that resonates with listeners."</p>
                                <p>International music researcher and critic G. Knops commented: "This song reflects the oppressive atmosphere in which the Vietnamese people had to struggle to survive. At that time, music was their only outlet for expressing their feelings. These songs are the history, the emotions of a nation..."</p>
                                <p>Because it effectively conveys the aspirations and reflects the life of the people, the works of composer Cao Văn Lầu, as well as those of talented artists such as Lê Tài Khị, Nguyệt Chiếu, Phạm Nguơn Kiên, Lê Văn Túc (Ba Chột), and Trịnh Thiên Tư, have enduring vitality. Even a German ethnomusicologist, at a symposium on composer Cao Văn Lầu held in Bạc Liêu in 1992, acknowledged: "As a traditional music form, although it has only been performed for about a hundred years, Southern amateur music and cải lương vọng cổ are among the newest and most widely spread traditional music forms."</p>
                                <p>Due to its universality, Southern amateur music has become increasingly widespread. Compared to other familiar traditional art forms such as cải lương, hát bội, and chèo, Southern amateur music is considered the most "popular" art form. To perform Southern amateur music, all you need is a few chairs or a mat on the floor, along with a few musicians and singers. Whether or not the instruments are amplified, the performance can still take place.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, in Bạc Liêu, it seems that as soon as the sounds of the đàn kìm, đàn cò, đàn tranh, and đàn bầu (the four essential instruments) are played, from lottery ticket sellers to motorbike taxi drivers to white-collar workers, everyone can sing along passionately, as if they were born to sing. Southern amateur music flows like a cultural current, weaving through the simple homes of the Mekong Delta, and has been preserved by generations to this day.</p>
