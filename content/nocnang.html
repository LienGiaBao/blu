                                        Noc Nang, those two words had becomea place name because the water here was deep in the past. If you wanted tobuild a house, you had to shock the venom, on the top of the venom there is acrutch to make a tree line to lie on. Many passersby saw that the house was damaged, and only the tree was left alone, so the locals called this place Noc Nang hamlet.

                                        In the early 1900s of the lastcentury, Huong Chinh Nguyen Thanh Luong was left by his father with 73ha ofreclaimed land in the forest at Noc Nang canal. In 1912, Huong Chanh Luong hadan applicati on to measure - grant a contract for the entire area of 73ha and was approved by Bac Lieu provincial president, including a map of the land. After that, his son Nguyen Van Toai (also known as Bien Toai) continued toinherit the land when he died.

                                        In 1917, Bang Tac, a notoriouslyrich overseas Chinese in Bac Lieu used tricks to appropriate the land of BienToais family. The land dispute between the two parties broke out and through many trials, Bien Toais family lost the lawsuit because Bang Tac used the money to bribe the authorities. After that, Bang Tac sold this land to the government. Paradoxically, the new owner forced the Bien Toai brothers to pay rent on their land.</p>

                                        Tragedy culminated in 1928 in Noc Nang field of Phong Thanh village, that the peasant family Muoi Chuc uprising against the colonial government and its hench men. The landowner Ma Ngan and Phu Huan useda lot of cunning tricks to help steal rice and land from Muoi Chuc’s family.

                                        The clash happened between two groups, the Muoi Chuc brothers who used spears and sticks to fight against the landlords and the French colonial government led by two persons that were CoTournier and Bauzou, and deputy manager Danh Long commanded evil soldiers, secret soldiers, Huong, Hoi te of Phong Thanh village took place very fiercely at Muoi Chuc rice field on the morning of February 16, 1928. Four people fivelives (Mrs. Nghia, Muoi Chuc’s wife was 7 months pregnant) the price was too expensive for the act of killing the Western soldiers to keep own land of the Muoi Chuc family. The French colonial government, Co Tournier died, and others were injured.

                                        At that time, Noc Nang was an attractive headline in Latribune Indochinois newspaper (Indochina Forum), Cong Luan newspaper, and Dong Phap Times newspaper… newspapers raced to denounce the colonialists and evillandlords to protect the poor farmer as Muoi Chuc family. On August 17, 1928, the Can Tho High Court tried the Noc Nang case, two French lawyers, Tricon and Jevaco, defended Mr. Tais brothers without any fee, but in front of the horse shoe, Mr. Tais brothers were accused of: "rebellious stick, anti-government, murder"

                                    <p>
                                        Mr. Tais family continued to file complaints and the pressalso strongly condemned, forced the French government to issue Decree No. 2315CB dated May 28, 1932, and granted a return of 50.40 hectares to Mr. Tais family. The Noc Nang event in 1928 is proof, that proved theoppressive and exploitative nature of the colonists and the henchmen. That wascausing anger in the hearts of the people of Cochinchina, the Vietnamese journalists, and the discontent of the progressive French.

                                        To record the event, the unrelenting feats of the Noc Nang farmers, the Party Committee, authorities, and the people of Bac Lieu province built Noc Nang historical relic site right at the place where the bloody war had taken place in the past, which was included many construction items such as the ricedrying yard and the tomb of Mr. and Ms. Tam Luong (Mr. Muoi Chucs parents) and his brothers, which were separated about 300m. Mr. and Ms. Tam Luongs graves were built by Muoi Chucs brothers after they died. After the Noc Nang event, those massacred were scattered nearby. By 1963, all the graves were gathered in the samearea.
